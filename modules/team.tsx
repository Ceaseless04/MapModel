This is your local MapFriends full stack developer/tech lead, nice to meet you :) As the technical lead of the project, I'd like to say that this was an amazing project to learn the google maps platform SDK, git, NextJs and many more things that me and my team were able to add to our skill set. It was tear-jerking at times and really exciting at times, the ordinary life of SDEs yatta! Enjoy this little piece as it comes straight from our hearts(and tears and smiles) :) ",

For this, I worked on some backend (Pst, behind-the-scenes code) and styling, delivering some functionalities, such as your profile picture input and the preview of the same, as well as some designs, such as the buttons you see and use on the main page (map page) among other tasks. We hope you get to enjoy the experience and make great use of this website!",

I organized the team, kept track of our progress, and made sure we were hitting our deadlines and created the prototype of the project. I also did the UX UI design work that went into making sure users had an easy time navigating through the web application. I worked with SCSS stylesheets to make sure user form looked good as well as verify pages.",

Leon, Cami, and I programmed and set up the firebase to receive and display profile pictures uploaded by the user, which are illustrated on a marker when profile is created. Lastly, I styled the how to steps with friendly instructions for new users to be able to create their accounts without hassle.",
